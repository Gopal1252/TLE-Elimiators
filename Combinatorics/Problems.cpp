//DR1
//https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/319/A (useless, no combinatorics particularly, btw) so didn't solve
//https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/288/B (just brute force, don't know how it didn't give tle)

//DR2
//https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/584/B (very interesting)
//https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/608/B //did myself ;)


//DR3
//https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1236/B interesting, used formula that nc1 + nc2 + nc3 + ... + ncn = (2^n - 1)   did myself ;)
//https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1102/E did myself ;)

//DR4
//https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1312/D //good combinatorics problem ,need to handle an edge case
//https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1284/C //difficult (not done yet)

//DR5
//https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1795/D //interesting, did myself :)
//https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1569/C //couldn't calc the required ways. So try -> total ways - non-required ways
//https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1475/E //easy (done myself)
